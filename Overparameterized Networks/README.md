# Overparameterized Networks (Optimization, Loss Landscape)

This folder contains papers that tried to understand overparameterized deep neural networks, mainly from the point of view of **optimization**, **loss landscape**, and possibly **generalization**. (Will most likely overlap with some of the other subfields.)



## Papers

- Fine-Grained Analysis of Optimization and Generalization for Overparameterized Two-Layer Neural Networks (Arora et al., *ICML'19*)
  - 
- A Convergence Theory for Deep Learning via Over-Parameterization (Allen-Zhu et al., *ICML'19*)
